# Spirit Detector / Spook Camera
The Spirit Detector application enables a user to pretend to be a Ghost Hunter.
<br><br>
The user of the app is known as the "Narrator"
<br>
The app is used as a prop to support a fictional story that include ghosts, spirits and other un-worldly entities.<br>
The app supports the "Narrator"as he pretends to scan for ghosts within a physical space utilizing the Augmented Reality capabilities of the iPhone and this app.<br>
The "Narrator" spins a story about an entity that will eventually end up in a photo with the "Narrators" children or friend.
The app is designed for an apple iPhone 12 or newer and IOS 11 or newer.
See a comprehensive list of supported devices here: https://www.apple.com/augmented-reality/ 
The buttons in the app enable the "Narrator" to Scan, Locate, and capture a ghost or entity in a physical space on a horizontal surface.
The app can then be used to take a photo of the ghost along with the "Narrator"s children or anyone else in the view finder.

# When the app is first opened
When the app is opened you are presented with the **Initial** "splash screen.

</div>

On the initial splash screen you are presented with three buttons.<br>
Choosing the **Scanner** button will open a new page with a green scanner indicator.<br>
When a spirit is located the indicator will turn red and a ghost image will be in the center of the indicator.<br>
The "Narrator" should use this opportunity to ham it up. 


# Capturing a ghost

When the **Scanner** button is pressed The screen changes to the scanning page. This page has a single **Capture** button at the bottom. <br>

The "Narrator" moves the device slowly around the room. Carefully watching for the scan indicator to turn RED.
When it turns red the "Narrater" slows down and when the time is just right.... he presses the "Capture" button.<br>
The "Narrator" should continue his story.<br> 

At this point the capture button is replaced by a "Trash Can" and a ghost or some other entity is in the viewfinder. The scanner is no longer visable.<br>
The "Narrator" should continue his story.<br> 

Pressing the "Trash Can" button will release all of the ghosts captured and restart the scanning session.<br><br>

# Using the Camera

After the "Narrator" has captured a ghost on the **Scanner** page The "Narrator" can use the back link near the top left of the page 
to return to the **Initial** splash screen. To use the camera the "Narrator" will choose and press the **Camera** button.<br>
This button will take the "Narrator" to the camera page. The camera page displays the ghost that was captured on the scanner page, in the cameras view finder.<br>
The "Narrator" continues the story and invites anyone brave enough to step forward to have their picture taken with the apparition.<br>
When the "Narrator" presses the shutter button at the bottom of the page, a photo is taken and placed in the phones photo gallery.<br>

When the "Narrator" is finished with the camera he can press the **Back** link to take the "Narrator" back to the **Initial** page.<br> 

The final button on the **Initial** splash page is the **Setup** button. Pressing this button takes the user to the setup page.<br>
Th buttons on the setup page are used to select a ghost that will appear when the capture button is pressed on the scanner page.<br>

# Sample Story

I have been told by many people that this room that we are standing in is haunted.
