# Spirit Detector / Spook Camera
**An Augmented reality project**<br>

The Spirit Detector application uses Apples augmented reality technology to enable a user to pretend to be a Ghost Hunter.
<br>
The user of the app is known as the "Narrator".
<br>
The Narrators job is to tell a story. 
The app is used as a prop to support the Narrators fictional story that include ghosts, spirits and other un-worldly entities.
The app supports the "Narrator"as he pretends to scan for ghosts within a physical space utilizing the Augmented Reality capabilities of the iPhone and this app.<br>
The "Narrator" spins a story about an entity that will eventually end up in a photo with the "Narrators" children or friend.
The app was tested on an apple iPhone 14 pro running IOS 16.1 but may work on an iPhone 12 or newer. The phone must support Apples Augmented reality.
The buttons in the app enable the "Narrator" to Scan, Locate, and capture a ghost or entity in a physical space on a horizontal surface.
The app can then be used to take a photo of the ghost along with the "Narrator"s children or anyone else in the view finder.

# When the app is first opened
When the app is opened, the **Initial** splash screen appears. 
# Scanning for ghosts<br>

</div>

On the initial splash screen you are presented with three buttons.<br>
Choosing the **Scanner** button will open a new page with a green scanner indicator. It is important that the Narrator hold the iPhone in a vertical position 
because tilting the phone forward slightly will trigger the red 'ghost detected' scanner indicator.<br>
During the Narrators story , When the Narrator says, 'A spirit is located' The Narrator should tilt the phone forward (about 45 degrees) which will trigger the red scanner indicator to 
turn on indicating that a spirit has been found.<br>
The "Narrator" should use this opportunity to embellish the story. 


# Capturing a ghost

Back to the scanning page.<br>
The Narrator has just pressed the **Scanner** button. The screen changed to the scanning page. This page has a single **Capture** button at the bottom. <br>

The "Narrator" moves the device slowly around the room. Carefully watching the green scanning indicator. The Narrator is watching for the scan indicator to turn RED.
The Narrator tilts the phone forward about 45 degrees and...
When the scan indicator turns red the "Narrator" slows down and when the time is just right.... the Narrator presses the "Capture" button.<br>
The "Narrator" should continue his story.<br> 

At this point the capture button is replaced by a "Trash Can" and a ghost or some other entity appears in the viewfinder. The scanner is no longer visible.<br>
The "Narrator" should continue his story.<br> 

Pressing the "Trash Can" button will release all of the ghosts captured and restart the scanning session.<br><br>

# Using the Camera

After the "Narrator" has captured a ghost on the **Scanner** page. The "Narrator" can use the back link near the top left of the page, or swipe right. 
to return to the **Initial** splash screen. To use the camera the "Narrator" will choose and press the **Camera** button.<br>
This button will take the "Narrator" to the camera page. The camera page displays the ghost that was captured on the scanner page, in the cameras view finder. The "Narrator" continues the story and invites anyone brave enough to step forward to have their picture taken with the apparition.<br>
When the "Narrator" presses the shutter button at the bottom of the page, a photo is taken and placed in the phones photo gallery.<br>

</div>

When the "Narrator" is finished with the camera he can press the **Back** link or swipe right to take the "Narrator" back to the **Initial** page.<br> 

The final button on the **Initial** splash page is the **Setup** button. Pressing this button takes the user to the setup page.<br>
The buttons on the setup page are used to select a ghost that will appear when the capture button is pressed on the scanner page.<br>

# Sample Story

**Instructions:**<br>

*Contrary to popular beliefs ghosts exsist everywhere but are most easily detected and captured in a well lit area, with a flat surface, such as a floor to stand on.*<br>

**The Story:**<br>
I have been told by many people that a room in this building may be haunted.<br>
Now, I don't believe in the super natural but to be cautious I wrote an app for my phone that<br>
can detect and capture invisable entities such as ghosts and gouls and spirits of all sorts.<br>
Well... it doesn't actually caprure the ghost but it captures an image of the ghost <br>(and leaves the actual ghost to continue on its way.)
So, no spiritual entities are harmed during the apps operation.<br>
The other thing we can do with this app is take a photo of the spirit, and, we can even be part of the photo.<br>
So, what to you guys think? Do you want to see if we can find a room with a ghost in it?

**Instructions:**<br>

*Hopefully your audience says yes and they enthusiastically follow you.*<br>
*You should now open the app and if you want a specific ghost to appear, go to the setup page and choose one*<br>
*Now press the scanner button on the initial page and hold the phone up and slowly move the phone around as if you are looking for*<br>
*something. When you decide that you want a ghost to be detected, tilt the phone forward until a red indicator appears.*<br><br>
*When it comes time to capture a ghost, the capture button can be pressed, even if the the scanner is green. But, be sure to point*<br>
*the animating scanner icon at a level horizontal area such as a floor, because a horizontal plane is needed to place the ghost in the frame,*<br>
*and the ghost will appear near the center of the animating scanner icon.*<br>

**More Story:**<br>

It looks like we have detected some sort of entity. Do you think we should try and capture it?<br>
I am pressing the capture button. And, it looks like we have captured an enchanted devils mask.<br>
Does anyone dare to stand next to the mask and let me take a picture?<br>

**Instructions:**<br>

*Change to the camera page. Center your subjects with the ghost and press the shutter button*<br>
*A photo will be taken and stored in the phones photo gallery*<br>

**Acknowledgments:**<br>

All of the code in the app was developed by me (Larry) but I used many many many websites as reference pages to figure
out how to accomplish each goal in my code. So, for the hard work of all of the people on the internet who took the time 
to explain "Swift" and "Xcode" or any other iPhone programming concept. I thank you very much.<br>
I want to also thank "pexels.com", "sketchfab.com", "pixabay.com" and "cgtrader.com" for providing repositories of 3D and 2D graphics
content used in this app.<br>
One other acknowledgment I want to make is to "Microsoft Bing". The "Spirit Detect" app was written at the very beginning of the Chat GPT like AI era.<br>
And, while I was writing some of this code I got stumped in a few spots. I used Bing Chat and asked it a few questions to see if it could point me in the right 
direction. And, I was absolutly amazed at how helpful the AI bot was. So, Thank you Microsoft and all of the engineers involved in its development.
