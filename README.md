# Spirit Detector / Spook Camera
The Spirit Detector application enables a user to pretend to be Ghost Hunters
<br><br>
The user of the app is known as the "Narrator"
<br>
The app is used as a prop to support a fictional story that include ghosts.
The app allows the "Narrator" to pretend to scan for ghosts within a physical space utilizing the Augmented Reality capabilities of the iPhone and this app.
The "Narrator" spins a story about the ghost that will eventually end with a photo of your children or friends and the ghost.
The app is designed for an apple iPhone 14 or newer and IOS 16 or newer. **<--- Maybe we should check**.
See a comprehensive list of supported devices here: https://www.apple.com/augmented-reality/ 
The buttons in the app enable the "Narrator" to Scan, Locate, and capture a ghost or entity in a physical space on a horizontal surface.
The app can then be used to take a photo of the ghost along with the "Narrator"s children or anyone else in the view finder.

# Scanning for ghosts
On the initial splash screen you are presented with three buttons.<br>
Choosing the **Scanner** button will open a new page with a green scanner indicator.<br>
When a spirit is located the indicator will turn red and a ghost image will be in the center of the indicator.<br>
The "Narrator" should use this opportunity to ham it up. 

# Capturing the ghost

When the **Scanner** button is pressed The screen changes to the scanning page. This page has a single **Capture** button at the bottom. <br>

The "Narrator" moves the device slowly around the room. Carefully watching for the scan indicator to turn RED.
When it turns red the "Narrater" slows down and when the time is just right.... he presses the "Capture" button.<br>
The "Narrator" should continue his story.<br> 

At this point the capture button is replaced by a "Trash Can" and a ghost or some other entity is in the viewfinder. The scanner is no longer visable.<br>
The "Narrator" should continue his story.<br> 

Pressing the "Trash Can" button will release all of the ghosts caprured and restart the scanning session.<br><br><br>

displays a ghost within the camera / scanner view finder.
The "Show Entity" buttn is replaced by a camera shutter button. At this point the "Narrator" can instruct 
a bystander where to position themselves for a photo of the bystander and the apparition.

When the "Narrator" is finished with the camera he can press the "Restart Scan" button to take the "Narrator" back to the scanning page.
